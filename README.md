# About
This repository contains code to work with the MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of a large number of handwritten digit images, each labeled with the corresponding digit.

## Files
### `utils.py`
This file contains utility functions for training and testing

### `models.py`
The models.py file contains the definition of a neural network model architecture for solving the MNIST classification problem. It defines the structure of the neural network using PyTorch.

### `s5.ipynb`
The s5.ipynb notebook contains the main code to train and evaluate a model on the MNIST dataset. It imports the necessary functions from utils.py to train and test the model , as well as the neural network architecture from models.py. The notebook then trains the model using the training data, evaluates its performance on the test data.

## Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-dataset.git
```
Open the s5.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment or any other compatible IDE.

Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the data, load the model architecture, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Experiment with different hyperparameters and training strategies to improve performance if desired.
